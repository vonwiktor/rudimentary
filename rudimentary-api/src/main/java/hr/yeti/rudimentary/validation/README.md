# Validation

### Introduction
Rudimentary provides simple way to set different types of constraints for incoming http request. These constraints are then checked automatically against `hr.yeti.rudimentary.validation.Validator` on `HttpEndpoint` level. `hr.yeti.rudimentary.validation.Validator` can of course be called manually anywhere in the code if you wish.
