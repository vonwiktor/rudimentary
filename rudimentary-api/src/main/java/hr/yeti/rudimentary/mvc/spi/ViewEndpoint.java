 * Specialized type of {@link HttpEndpoint} used in MVC. It has a default response type set to {@link View}.

 * Since this interface inherently extends {@link Instance} it means it is loaded automatically via
 * {@link ServiceLoader} on application startup.
 *
 * You can have as many different ViewEndpoint providers as you want and you can register them in
 * <i>src/main/resources/META-INF/services/hr.yeti.rudimentary.http.spi.HttpEndpoint</i>
 * file.
 *
 * For this endpoint to work properly it is required to have {@link ViewEngine} registered.
